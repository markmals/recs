The first game console I ever asked for was an original Xbox, solely so I could play Spider-Man 2.
This Spider-Man game is basically a remake of Spider-Man 2, mechanics-wise, so I’m enthralled. Swing
around an open-world Manhattan, recreated to be close to identical to the real thing. This game has
enough structure to keep me playing balanced with enough open-world exploration to pique my
interest. Now that it’s available for the Steam Deck, it’s the only game I’ll be playing until I
finish it.
