A new restaurant from Chef Fermín Núñez on the east side, focused on Mexican seafood. Needless to
say, it’s incredible. Chef Fermín recommends the Camarones “El Ricas” (pictured) — butterflied
shell-on shrimp, lime, chile costeño garlic butter, and cilantro — which are fantastic. Great fish
taco options (on Suerte’s amazing blue corn tortillas) as well.
