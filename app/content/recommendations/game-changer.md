From the company formerly known as College Humor, a fun and quirky game show where the game is new and different every episode. Games range from escape rooms to innuendo competitions to Simon Says to improv karaoke to Bachelor and Survivor parodies. Including a rotating cast of contestants, most of whom will be familiar to those who follow the LA indie comedy and/or podcast comedy scene, and a host (Sam Reich) who exudes joy every episode, I can't recommend Game Changer enough.

<aside>

Dropout is a fantastic, truly indie streamer with tons of other shows, many of which are actually Game Changer spin-offs. If you enjoy watching the cast of Game Changer, you'll love getting to know them better on [the other Dropout series](https://www.dropout.tv/new-releases).
