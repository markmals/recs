The first season was a little slow for my taste. I still watched all the way through, but it was so
slow that I was considering skipping the second season alltogether. I'm glad I didn't. It starts out
more exciting than the first ever got and by the time you get to the linked episode, they're pulling
sci-fi stunts on the scale of Game of Thrones. A very fun season that has me excited for the next.
