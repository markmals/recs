Canje is an extraordinary caribbean restaurant in East Austin. I learned about it from [the Bon Appétit YouTube series "On The Line"](https://youtu.be/p1NN-jCF9Hg) and made plans to go with a friend almost immediately after watching. We ordered every dish featured in the video and they were all amazing. The salt fish accra, the wild boar pepperpot (pictured), the incredibly flaky roti, the jerk chicken, the maduros, and a few drinks. I can only describe the experience as transcendental. One of the best dining experiences I’ve ever had.
