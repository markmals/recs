A show that oscillates between a stereotypical sitcom about a dumbshit husband with a wife who is
too good for him and a hard drama about a woman trying to get out of her relationship, with
cinematography styles and canned laughter to match. King of Queens meets Breaking Bad. Annie Murphy
from Schittâ€™s Creek stars and is incredible, as she is in everything.
