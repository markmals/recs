Lauren Lapkus, Paul F. Tompkins, and Scott Aukerman — three comedians and real-life friends who have
performed numerous times together — tell stories from their past and present while joking with each
other. Listening to this podcast feels like spending time with good friends. My all-time favorite
podcast.
