I've thought these three boys were hilarious since they started uploading videos to Twitter during lockdown in 2020. I was ecstatic to see them hired by SNL, where we get to see a new, well produced short video from them nearly every week. I was skeptical that their 3 minute bits would hold up in a 90 minute form, but I think this film turned out fantastic. It has several laugh out loud moments that are only enhanced by other cast members, Meg Stalter, X Mayo, and Conan O'Brien (in his first film role not playing himself!), to mention a few.
